An opiniated set of lint rules for Dart and Flutter projects. Made by yours truly Floating Dartists.

You can use 2 different sets of rules:

* `dart`: for Dart projects
* `flutter`: for Flutter projects (includes `dart` rules)

## Install

Add the version you want to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  fd_lints: ^1.0.0
```

Creates an `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```yaml
include: package:fd_lints/dart.yaml # For Dart projects
# include: package:fd_lints/flutter.yaml # For Flutter projects
```
